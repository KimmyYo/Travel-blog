                <div class="content">
                    <div class="sub_title">Transportation</div>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Don’t fly direct: When booking flights, sometimes it is cheaper to fly in to airports close to your final destination, and then take a train or bus to where you need to go. Some useful flight search engines: Skyscanner, Google Flights</li>
                            <li>Make extra copies of your passport and important documents: Don’t forget to e-mail a copy to yourself too. You never know when you might need to have some sort of documentation. Additionally, if your passport gets stolen, having a copy will come in handy for your police report.</li>
                            <li>Take free walking tours: A lot of cities are super easy to explore on foot. Being on the streets lets you see a lot of cool and beautiful architecture, experience the people around you, just make sure you to look out for bikes/cars and always use crosswalks when crossing streets.</li>
                            <li>Always visit the local tourism office: They can point you to free activities, special events during your stay, and sometimes even offer discounts on attractions and transportation.</li>
                            <li>Get travel insurance: Travel insurance is the most important thing you get that you never want to use. If something goes wrong, you don’t want to be out thousands of dollars in bills. It’s comprehensive and, for just a few dollars a day, one of the best investments you can get for a trip.</li>
                        </ol>   
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <div class="sub_title">Food</div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Never eat in a touristy area or near a tourist attraction: The closer you are to tourist attractions the more you are going to pay. Use websites or apps to find some delicious and popular restaurants around you. Additionally, never eat anywhere the menu is in like 6 languages! That means the restaurant is just for tourists!</li>
                        <li>Eat street food: If you skip the street food, you miss out on culture. Don’t be scared. If you’re nervous, look for places where kids are eating. If it’s safe enough for them, then it’s safe enough for you.</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <div class="sub_title">Clothing</div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Don’t buy money belts: Thieves know you are a traveler when you wear a money belt with you. The more you can blend in and act like a local, the easier it will be to get deals and avoid touts. If you’re worried about pickpockets, keep a better eye on your stuff.</li>
                        <li>Get good shoes, not new shoes: You walk a lot when you travel. Don’t beat up your feet. Love them as much as they love you, and they’ll take you to amazing places.</li>
                        <li>Take pictures of your luggage and clothes: If your bag gets lost, this will help identify it more easily and speed up the process of having your travel insurance reimburse you.</li>
                        <li>Take a jacket: Nights get chilly.</li>
                    </ol>
