                        The best impression of Penang is the food and chinese culture in Penang. Cantonese-style noodles, dessert, Burburchacha..., every food I'd tried is beyond my expectation, with surprise, amaze, and delight.

                        Recalling the history textbook that Chinese culture had spread to south-east Asia. I saw so much building, temple and even the language they use are like different dialect of Taiwanese.
                        If you got a chance to walk through every alley in Penang, you will be amazed by how beautiful those traditional building look like.

                        Penang is also a place with a various of culture, especially Indian, Malaysian, and Chinese culture. Without taking a long filght to different countries, one can experience these culture in a small state.
                        One thing that I remembered the most is while I was taking the taxi, different taxi drivers with different races played the radio that belongs to their language. Although it might be something small, it is something that you can't easily experience.
                        There's also a place call "Small India", as the name of the area shown, it's a region with a great amout of India culture. Not only their food, but also India traditional clothing, Hindu temple. 
                        As I stepped into the area, I felt like I was standing in India. Moreover, "Small India" is not like a absolute region with boundaries, it even let Mosque, temples, Hindu temple lied in the same place.

                        Another attracting area I'd visited is "Georgetown", it's an area with soooooo much amazing street art. 
                        I even got a map to go around every small alley in the town to find those street art.
